		<h2>7.5 Facebook </h2>
			<p>Facebook Social Plugins: This website uses social plugins of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc. The plugins are inserted within a visible Facebook logo or with the addition of “Facebook Social Plugin” sign. The list and the appearance of the Facebook social plugins can be found here <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>. By integrating the plugin, Facebook receives information that a user has accessed our website. If the user is logged into Facebook, Facebook can assign the website visit to that user’s Facebook account. When users interact with plugins like the Like button or leave a comment, the corresponding information is sent directly from your browser and stored on Facebook.<br/>
				Purpose and scope of data collection and further processing and use of data through Facebook and the relevant rights and ways to protect the privacy your privacy as relates to Facebook can be found in Facebook’s Privacy Policy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>. <br/>
			If you have a Facebook account and do not want Facebook to collect information about your activities on this website and link such information to your account data stored on Facebook, you must log off on Facebook before visiting our website. It is also possible to block Facebook social plugins with an add-on for your browser, for example, the “Facebook Blocker”. 
				Facebook SDK: Within our app, we use the Software Development Kit (SDK) from Facebook. The Facebook SDK is issued and administered by Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. By means of this integration, we can link various Facebook services with our app. For example, users can use the Facebook SDK to share contents of our apps on their own Facebook timeline, or to send messages to other Facebook users. Further information about Facebook SDK within iOS can be found here: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios</a>. For Android, please refer to: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android</a>.
				Facebook Login via the SDK: In order to use Facebook services within our apps, you will need to first use Facebook Login to connect with Facebook. This requires that you have an existing Facebook account or that you create a Facebook account. If you want to use your Facebook account to log in to our services, you will be guided directly in a first step to Facebook, where Facebook will ask you to sign in or register. In no event will we learn your personal login information (username and password). In a second step, you can link your Facebook profile with each service you want to register to use. You will then receive a separate notice detailing which data is transferred to us from your Facebook profile. This generally includes your “public information” on Facebook and anything you make public or make accessible to the respective application. This generally includes your name, your profile and cover picture, your gender, your networks, your username (Facebook URL) and your user identifier (Facebook ID). In order to communicate with you without going through Facebook, we also use the e-mail address you have registered with Facebook. You can check and modify the status of your connection to Facebook and the respective access privileges of our apps at any time under your Facebook profile settings (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications</a>). Here, you will also find an overview of which information in your profile is public. If you want to cancel the connection between Facebook and our apps, please log in to Facebook and make the necessary changes in your profile settings. We will then no longer be able to access information from your Facebook profile in order to serve you. <br/>
			Facebook App Events: We use the Facebook SDK service called “Facebook App Events” to evaluate the reach of our advertising campaigns and use of Facebook SDK. Facebook merely provides us with an aggregated analysis of user behavior with our app. We also have no influence on the information that will be processed by Facebook App Events. In our app settings, you can opt out of using App Events for the given purposes. </p>
			<p>7.6 Twitter: This website uses the Twitter Follow button. This button is offered by Twitter, Inc. The Follow button is a small button displayed on our website to help users easily follow our Twitter account. A Follow button consists of two parts: a link to a follow web intent page on Twitter.com and Twitter’s widgets JavaScript to enhance the link with Twitter’s official and easily recognizable Follow button.
