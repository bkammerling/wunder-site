			</ul>

		<h2>5. SAFETY</h2>
			<p> General General legal liability rules apply to members of our Community. Consequently, all claims between Community members in relation to the Wunder Community or Community rides must be agitated directly amongst the Community members. In the event of any dispute, Wunder may try to facilitate an agreement amongst the Community member but is not responsible for reaching a resolution. In the case of a legal dispute between Community members or if a Community member learns about the abuse of the Wunder App or of a behavior detrimental to other Community members or the Community per se, the member commits to inform Wunder immediately. </p>
			<p>Insurance </p>
			<p> The Driver agrees and undertakes that he or she will take out and maintain insurance to cover the Trip and any carpooling offered or booked through the platform. The Driver agrees that he or she will, on request, provide the Passenger with evidence in advance of the Trip of the complete validity of his or her insurance policy. The Driver shall also ensure that she/he has in place all insurances required under law, including third party insurance. </p>
			<p> The Driver also undertakes that he will hold a valid driving license and that the Driver will own or will be entitled to use the Vehicle and that the Vehicle will have authorization to drive and the Passenger is entitled to request evidence of the Driver’s insurance and driving license at any time up to completion of the Trip. </p>
			<p> It is up to each Driver and Passenger to confirm with each other that the Driver is covered by valid insurance for a Trip. The Driver must confirm that his or her insurance policy allows him or her to carry Passengers and that the insurance policy covers all Passengers and any accident or incident which may occur during a Trip. </p>
			<p> It is Wunder’s understanding that a Trip during which a Passenger contributes only towards travel expenses is not a Trip for “hire or reward”. A Passenger in such a Trip is a third party passenger who is covered by compulsory third party insurance. However, Wunder gives no warranty or assurance in this regard and it is the Driver’s responsibility to verify that their insurance provides adequate cover. </p>		
			<p> The Driver and the Passenger are aware that standard non-commercial insurance policies may refuse to cover loss or damage arising in the event that the Driver had made or was seeking to make a profit. The Driver may collect no payment from the Passenger other than the Cost Contribution and the Driver must not, in any event, make a profit. </p>
			<p> The Driver, therefore, undertakes to calculate his or her expenses (fuel, toll, maintenance, repairs, depreciation, insurance, cleaning, interest of loan payment, loss in value of his or her Vehicle) and guarantees that the total Cost Contributions requested from his or her Passengers does not result in any profit. If the Driver does make a profit, or if the insurers repudiate or refuse to accept any claim arising during a Trip for any other reason, the Driver will be responsible for the financial consequences, losses, and damages arising and Wunder will not be liable under any circumstances to the Driver or the Passenger. </p>
			<p> The Wunder App proposes a suggested price for the trip, based on a fixed fee and costs per kilometer per ride of a standard vehicle used by Wunder drivers. </p>		
			<p> The Driver may adjust the price per kilometer based on the actual expenses encountered by his vehicle. If the driver offers rides in medium or large sized vehicle, the likely expenses per kilometer will be higher and thus there is a possibility to adjust the pricing up to a maximum allowed price. The vehicle expenses may differ, depending on the model, year of purchase, fuel efficiency and level of maintenance of the car. Wunder is thus in no position to determine the final price of the ride.However, Wunder provides suggestions and limits any excessive pricing, which may be deemed to be commercial or for hire. </p>
			<p> Disputes </p>	
			<p> Wunder shall provide its Users with an online service for resolving disputes. This service is non-binding. Wunder is under no obligation to seek to resolve disputes and this service is offered at Wunder’s sole discretion and may be withdrawn at any time. If a dispute is not settled, Wunder reserves the right to retain any sums paid by the Passenger until an amicable agreement has been reached between the Passenger and the Driver or a definitive judicial decision has been made. </p>	
							
			<h2>6. COMMUNITY RIDES</h2>
			<p> The core of the Wunder Community is to facilitate Community rides via the Wunder App. The Wunder App allows our members to organize shared rides ("") within a safe and trustworthy Community and to share any costs through a fair contribution to Drivers’ expenses. </p>
			<p> No Contractual Relationship between Driver and Passenger </p>
			<p> Wunder Community rides are favors between Community members. No contract (e.g., transportation contract) is made between Drivers and Passengers. The Wunder Community and the Wunder App must not be abused to facilitate contracts between Community members. Giving a ride based on a contractual obligation is not a Community trip even if the Wunder App is used to facilitate the trip. Claims against Wunder, especially for an invoice or the reimbursement of fees, cannot be based on such abuse. </p>
			<p> Cancelling Transactions </p>
			<p> Wunder has the right to cancel a transaction at any point in time solely at its discretion. Reasons for cancellation can include, without limitation: </p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:number; padding-left: 30px; line-height: 30px;">
				<li><p>Drivers and passengers have not confirmed a Trip;</p></li>
				<li><p>There is no interaction between the Driver and Passenger on the Wunder App;</p></li>
				<li><p>Wunder finds a User acting against these Terms and Conditions.</p></li>	
			</ul>
			<p> Banning of Drivers and Passengers </p>
			<p> Wunder constitutes a circle of trust and it is important that these trust levels be maintained. As such, Wunder may, at its sole discretion, ban Users from the platform for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to potential suspicious activity such as money laundering, fraudulent transactions via credit cards etc. We retain the right to report and cooperate with the local law enforcement in these cases. </p>
			<p> Cost Sharing </p>
			<p> After finishing a Community trip, the Passenger shall contribute to the Driver’s expenses through the payment system integrated into the Wunder App. The Wunder App incorporates a proprietary cost sharing algorithm designed to calculate the cost of the ride and to share it between the Driver and the Passengers, equitably. </p>
			<p> In addition, Wunder reserves the right to charge an administrative fee for any ride. The amount is to be determined by Wunder, depending on its geography. The administrative fee covers costs for technology, services provided and support costs. </p>

		<h2>7. PAYMENTS & TAXES</h2>
			<p> Participating in the Wunder Community is free. </p>
			<p> The Passenger shall not pay any reimbursement to the Driver for a Community trip beyond sharing in the cost of the Trip. Wunder does not process the payments towards costs by itself. Payments are processed by One Communications Limited (PayTM) in India or Dragonpay in the Philippines (""), which will process payouts and deductions ("") through a third party payment gateway (“”) for Wunder for any electronic payments. </p>
			<p> Wunder Wallet </p>
			<p> In certain countries, we facilitate payments through a closed wallet (the “” or “” in the Wunder app). All money uploaded to the Wunder Wallet is solely to be used to pay for Wunder Carpool rides. </p>
			<p> All electronic payments are only to be processed via the Wunder Wallet, supported by the Payment Provider. Wunder is not responsible for any delays or problems caused by or on account of the Payment Provider. </p>
			<p> Once a Community member contributes to Driver’s expenses or otherwise sets off a payment within the Community, the amount is charged to the payment method on file with our payment provider. Once a payment has been made to any Driver, the Payment (including any deduction or Administrative Fee) is nonrefundable regardless of the trip or any other disruption that was caused (including but not limited to accidents). </p>
			<p> Promotional Offers </p>
			<p> Wunder may offer promotional offers to any User and these promotional offers are given at the sole discretion of Wunder. Any promotional discounts, offers and reward points in the form of Wunder Wallet money/points accumulated can be revoked without prior notice in the event of suspicious account activity or mala fide intent of the User. </p>
			<p> Cancelled Transaction </p>
			<p> If a payment to the WunderWallet in respect of a cancelled transaction was successful, then the money is refunded to the Users. Wunder aims to make such payments within [90] business days, but cannot be held liable for any delays that are beyond its control. </p>
			<p> Bank Account </p>
			<p> Drivers are required to create an account with our payment provider and record a functional personal bank account to receive any expense contribution payouts. </p>
			<p> Passengers are required to record a valid payment method with our payment provider using the Wunder App. </p>
			<p> Wunder has to be notified immediately and in writing about all inconsistencies in processing the expense contributions. If no claims are made within one month after an expense contribution is processed, it is considered as accepted by the receiver. If a deduction fails or is reversed, the debtor will immediately balance the missing amount. If the failure is due to reasons within the control of the debtor (e.g., the payment method on file is no longer valid or does not have sufficient coverage, a payment is reversed based on the order of the debtor, etc.), the debtor also has to cover any damages that occurred due to the failure. If the payout to the bank account on file fails Wunder will notify the Community member and ask that the bank account on file be corrected. The amount to be paid out will be added to the next regular payout and paid out at the same time as the next payout. </p>
			<p> Tax obligations of Drivers </p>
			<p> If you are driving, you agree to pay all taxes that may apply to the payments you receive from Passengers and this responsibility rests solely with you.</p>

			<p>Without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available, if WunderCar is damaged due to the negligent behavior of a Community member, the Community member will reimburse for all loss, damage or costs that may be attributable to her or his action or inaction, regardless of whether such loss, damage or cost was foreseeable or direct.</p>
